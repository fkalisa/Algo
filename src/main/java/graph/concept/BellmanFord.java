    The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex
    to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[1] It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for
    the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge
     weights are negative numbers.
